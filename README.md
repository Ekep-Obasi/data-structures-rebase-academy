# Rebase Academy - Data Structures Implementation

Welcome to the Data Structures Implementation repository for the Data Structures and Algorithms course! Here, you'll find comprehensive implementations of various data structures in JavaScript. These implementations serve as learning resources and reference materials for understanding the fundamental concepts of data structures.

## Introduction

Data structures are essential components of computer science and software development. They provide efficient ways to organize and manipulate data, enabling efficient algorithms and solutions to complex problems.

## Data Structures Implemented

1. [**Linked Lists**](): Singly linked list, doubly linked list.
2. [**Stacks**]():  linked list-based stack.
3. [**Queues**]():  queue, linked list-based queue.
4. [**Trees**](): Binary search tree, AVL tree, Red-Black tree.
5. [**Graphs**](): Adjacency list representation.

## How to Use

Each data structure implementation is contained within its own directory. Inside each directory, you'll find a JavaScript file containing the implementation along with relevant comments and explanations. Additionally, there may be accompanying test files to validate the correctness and performance of the implementations.

To use a data structure implementation:

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired data structure.
2. Open the JavaScript file containing the each data-structure.
3. Try to implement it yourself
4. Test your solution by running

```shell
npm run test
```
5. Checkout to the `feat/implementation` to view the implementation of each data-structure
6. Read through the code comments to understand the implementation details.


## Disclaimer

Please note that while these implementations aim to demonstrate the functionality and principles of data structures, they may not always be the most optimized versions. You can raise and issue if you find something wrong!
